<h1> About Me </h1>
<p>My practice is centred on an abstract exploration of paintingâ€™s fundamentals- colour, shape, pictorial space, gesture and surface. Through a combination of insight and intuition, my paintings explore a visible tension between the surface and the application of paint. The aluminium plate undergoes the same scrutiny each time, layers of paint battle against the lustrous surface; some sit comfortably whilst others hover awkwardly. My gradual process of responding to the fluctuating surface sees the paintings become essentially self-referential- this complex visual language forces forms to appear, disappear and repeat until an internal logic is established. Although small in size, my work challenges the viewer by constructing an image in which scale is inherent; the spectator is invited to inhabit the painted surface. Receding plains, veiling glazes and architectural forms transform the small surface into an image with great depth and an absurd sense of scale. Although each painting is inherently individual, forms and tones drift between works establishing a constant dialogue; the viewer becomes complicit in this intimate exchange as they enter the uncanny environment of both the painted surface and the exhibition space.</p>
